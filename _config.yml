        sub_title: Expert Finding in Legal Community Question Answering
        
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            Expert finding has been well-studied in community question answering (QA) systems in various domains. However, none of these studies addresses expert finding in the legal domain, where the goal is for citizens to find lawyers based on their expertise. In the legal domain, there is a large knowledge gap between the experts and the searchers, and the content on the legal QA websites consist of a combination formal and informal communication. In this paper, we propose methods for generating query-dependent textual profiles for lawyers covering several aspects including sentiment, comments, and recency. We combine query-dependent profiles with existing expert finding methods. Our experiments are conducted on a novel dataset gathered from an online legal QA service. We discovered that taking into account different lawyer profile aspects improves the best baseline model. We make our dataset publicly available for future work.

        sub_title: "Combining lexical and neural retrieval with longformer-based summarization for effective case law retrieval"
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            In this paper, we combine lexical and neural ranking models for case law retrieval. In this task, the query is a full case document, and the candidate documents are prior cases that are potentially relevant to the current case. Most documents are longer than 1024 tokens, which makes retrieval and classification with Transformer-based models problematic. We create shorter query documents with different methods: term extraction, noun phrase extraction, entity extraction, and automatic summarization using Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED). We then combine the summaries with five different ranking models: a BM25 ranker, statistical language modelling, the Deep Relevance Matching Model (DRMM), a Vanilla BERT ranker, and a Longformer ranker. We optimised all models and combined the best lexical ranker with neural retrieval models using different ensemble classifiers. We evaluate our methods on the retrieval benchmarks from COLIEE’20 and COLIEE’21. We beat state-of-the-art models for case law retrieval with both benchmark sets. Our experiments show the importance of tuning lexical retrieval methods, summarizing query documents, and combining lexical and neural models into one ranker for effective case law retrieval.

        sub_title: "Anonymous Commenting: A Greedy Approach to Balance Utilization and Anonymity for Instagram Users"
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            In many online services, anonymous commenting is not possible for the users; therefore, the users can not express their critical opinions without disregarding the consequences. As for now, naïve approaches are available for anonymous commenting which cause problems for analytical services on user comments. In this paper, we explore anonymous commenting approaches and their pros and cons. We also propose methods for anonymous commenting where it's possible to protect the user privacy while allowing sentimental analytics for service providers. Our experiments were conducted on a real dataset gathered from Instagram comments which indicate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in privacy protection and sentimental analytics. The proposed methods are independent of a particular website and can be utilized in various domains.

        sub_title: "Query Understanding via Entity Attribute Identification"
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            Understanding searchers' queries is an essential component of semantic search systems. In many cases, search queries involve specific attributes of an entity in a knowledge base (KB), which can be further used to find query answers. In this study, we aim to move forward the understanding of queries by identifying their related entity attributes from a knowledge base. To this end, we introduce the task of entity attribute identification and propose two methods to address it:(i) a model based on Markov Random Field, and (ii) a learning to rank model. We develop a human annotated test collection and show that our proposed methods can bring significant improvements over the baseline methods.
